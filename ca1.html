      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        in babylonian astrology,stars Pollux and Castor were known as the Great
        Twins. Their names were Lugal-irra and Meslamta-ea. meaning "The Mighty
        King" and "The one who has arisen from the Underworld".Both names are
        titles of Nergal, a major Babylonian god of plague and pestilence, who
        has king of the underworld. in Greek mythology,Gemini is associated with
        the myth of Castor and Pollux.Pollux was the son of Zeus, who seduced
        Leda,while Caster was the son of Tyndareus, the king of Sparta and
        Leda's husband.When Castor died,because he was a mortal,Pollux begged
        his father Zues to give Castor immortality,which was done through
        uniting them together in the heavens.
